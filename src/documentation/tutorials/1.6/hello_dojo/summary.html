Welcome! In this tutorial, we'll start from the ground up, with a simple HTML page. By the end of this tutorial, we'll have loaded Dojo into the page, as well as put some of the core functions to work. We'll touch on Dojo's modular structure, and discuss how to load dependencies into the page to make a richer experience.
