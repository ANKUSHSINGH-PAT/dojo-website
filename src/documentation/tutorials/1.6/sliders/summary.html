The HTML5 specification provides many new features, such as the <code>&lt;input type=&quot;range&quot;></code> element which allows users to choose from a range of values.  Unfortunately, this new input type is not supported in all browsers, and looks different in each browser that does support it.  That's where Dijit's HorizontalSlider and VerticalSlider widgets come in: flexible, themeable, and functional.
