<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><code>dojo.mixin</code>, <code>dojo.safeMixin</code>, and <code>dojo.extend</code>
are all used to augment an original object with properties from one or more other objects.
In this context, the other objects are called “mixins”. There are small differences
between each of these functions that make them suitable for different use cases.
Here's a quick overview of the differences before we dive in:</p>

<h3>dojo.mixin</h3>

<p>The <code>dojo.mixin</code> method is a simple utility function that,
given any number of objects as arguments, adds the properties of subsequent objects
to the first object and returns it. For example, let's say we have an existing
object to which we need to add some additional properties.
This might be a collection of form data, some data for a template, a namespace object,
or a settings object. In any case, without <code>dojo.mixin</code>,
copying over several properties might look like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">var formData = dojo.formToObject(dojo.byId('form'));
formData.name = currentUser.name;
formData.phone = currentUser.phone;
formData.address = currentUser.address;
formData.city = currentUser.city;
formData.province = currentUser.province;
formData.country = currentUser.country;
formData.postalCode = currentUser.postalCode;</pre>

<p>That's a lot of typing just to copy data from one object to another.
Assuming <em>all</em> the properties in the second object were meant to be
copied to the first, <code>dojo.mixin</code> makes this work much simpler:</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">var formData = dojo.formToObject(dojo.byId("form"));
dojo.mixin(formData, currentUser);</pre>

<p>Notice how the return value of this call was discarded.  This is because
<code>dojo.mixin</code> works directly on the first object passed in,
so we don't need to manually update the <code>formData</code> variable at all.</p>

<p><code>dojo.mixin</code> can also mix in multiple objects at the same time.
For example, if you had a settings object on a prototype that always needed to
contain certain default values whenever a new instance was created, you could
simply write it like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">var defaultSettings = {
	useTheForce: true,
	isEvil: false,
	length: 75,
	color: "blue"
};

function Lightsaber(settings){
	// `defaultSettings` is first mixed into the blank object,
	// then `settings` is mixed into the blank object, overriding
	// any properties from `defaultSettings` without altering
	// the `defaultSettings` object
	this.settings = dojo.mixin({}, defaultSettings, settings);
}

var darthsaber = new Lightsaber({
	isEvil: true,
	color: "red"
});

// { useTheForce: true, isEvil: true, length: 75, color: "red" }
console.log("darthsaber:", darthsaber.settings);
</pre>

<h3>dojo.safeMixin</h3>

<p><code>dojo.safeMixin</code> primarily accomplishes the same task as
<code>dojo.mixin</code>, with three important differences:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It can only mix in one object at a time</li>
	<li>It will not mix in the <code>constructor</code> property</li>
	<li>It will add annotations to functions to make them function properly with
		<code>dojo.declare</code>'s <code>this.inherited</code> function</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite what the name implies, there is nothing “unsafe” about the original
<code>dojo.mixin</code>, unless:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You are adding functions to an instance of an object created with
		<code>dojo.declare</code>, <em>and</em>:
		<ul>
			<li>you rely on calls to <code>this.inherited</code> within those new functions, or</li>
			<li>one or more of the mixins contains a <code>constructor</code> property</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, outside of cases involving instances of instances of
<code>dojo.declare</code>d classes, <code>dojo.mixin</code> is likely to be sufficient.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note that <code>dojo.declare</code>
itself also uses <code>dojo.safeMixin</code> when hooking up inheritance chains.
Additionally, <code>dojo.declare</code>d constructors expose an <code>extend</code>
method, which is really just an alias for calling <code>dojo.safeMixin</code> with
the declared constructor's prototype as the first argument.  This is not to be
confused with <code>dojo.extend</code>, which we will examine next.</p>

<h3>dojo.extend</h3>

<p><code>dojo.extend</code> is very similar to <code>dojo.mixin</code>, except that
it adds properties to the first object's <code>prototype</code> instead of
directly on the object itself. Directly augmenting an object's prototype is useful
if you want to make changes that immediately affect all inheriting instances:</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">
// Assume Lightsaber is defined as in the previous example

var darthsaber = new Lightsaber({
	isEvil: true,
	color: "red"
});

var weaponMixin = {
	hp: 5,
	maxHp: 10,
	repair: function() {
		if(this.hp >= this.maxHp) {
			console.log("Can't repair!");
			return;
		}

		this.hp++;
	},
	swing: function() {
		if(!this.hp) {
			console.log("Weapon is broken!");
			return;
		}

		this.hp--;
		console.log(Math.random() >= 0.5 ? "hit!" : "miss!");
	}
};

dojo.extend(Lightsaber, weaponMixin);

// Now we can call swing() on our Lightsaber instance,
// even though we augmented the prototype after creating the instance.
darthsaber.swing(); // "hit!" (or "miss!" if you are unlucky)
</pre>
<a class="demoBtn demo" href="demo/extend.html">View Demo</a>

<p>This is much more performant than calling <code>dojo.mixin</code> on every
new object that is created, as it modifies one inherited object rather than several
child objects.  It is also faster than using <code>dojo.safeMixin</code>.
However, should you need to augment a <code>dojo.declare</code>d constructor with
functions that respect calls to <code>this.inherited</code>, you should use
<code>dojo.safeMixin</code>, or the <code>extend</code> method on the constructor:</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">var Lightsaber = dojo.declare({
	constructor: function(settings){
		this.settings = dojo.mixin({}, defaultSettings, settings);
	}
});

// same augmentation, but calls to this.inherited won't break:
Lightsaber.extend(weaponMixin); </pre>

<p class="proTip">
Note that using <code>dojo.extend</code> or <code>declaredConstructor.extend</code>
effectively modifies the prototype of the constructor in question, affecting
<em>all</em> created instances.  Thus, it is important to limit usage of these
functions to cases where you are certain this effect is appropriate, as it could
otherwise produce unwanted side-effects.  In particular, remember that when
creating customizations of out-of-the-box components, it is recommended
to create a derivative using <code>dojo.declare</code>, rather than
augment the existing prototype.
</p>

<h3>Shallow vs deep copies</h3>

<p>It is important to note that the mixin functions we have introduced
perform “shallow” copies.  For example:</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">
var a = {
	name: "a",
	subObject: {
		foo: "bar"
	}
};
var b = dojo.mixin({}, a);

b.name = "b";
b.subObject.foo = "baz";

console.log("a b, as expected:",
	a.name, b.name);
console.log("true - both subObjects reference the exact same object:",
	a.subObject === b.subObject);
console.log("baz baz - a change to one subObject affects both:",
	a.subObject.foo, b.subObject.foo);
</pre>

<p>In simple cases, this behavior is not a problem; in some cases it may even be desirable.
However, in cases where you do not want objects to be shared, you can perform a
“deep” copy using <code>dojo.clone</code>:</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">
var a = {
	name: "a",
	subObject: {
		foo: "bar"
	}
};
var b = dojo.clone(a);

b.name = "b";
b.subObject.foo = "baz";

console.log("a b, same as before:",
	a.name, b.name);
console.log("false - the subObjects are different now:",
	a.subObject === b.subObject);
console.log("bar baz - a change to one subObject no longer affects all:",
	a.subObject.foo, b.subObject.foo);
</pre>
<a class="demoBtn demo" href="demo/clone.html">View Demo</a>

<p>Keep in mind that deep copies can be <em>significantly</em> slower than shallow copies,
and will cause scripts to hang if used on recursive data structures.
Deep copies should be used only when absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Dojo simplifies the process of creating and augmenting objects and classes.
The <code>dojo.mixin</code> and <code>dojo.safeMixin</code> methods offer a
convenient way to add and modify properties on an object, and <code>dojo.extend</code>
makes it easy to modify the prototype of an object.  Remember, though, that these
functions perform shallow copies.</p>
