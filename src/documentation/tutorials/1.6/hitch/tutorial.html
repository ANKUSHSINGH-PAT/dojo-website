<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p class="proTip">
For the purposes of this tutorial, we will assume that you have basic knowledge of
Dojo Toolkit constructs such as <a href="/documentation/tutorials/1.6/using_query/">dojo.query</a> and other language-based
helper functions, such as Dojo's <a href="/documentation/tutorials/1.6/arrays/">Array helpers</a>.
</p>
<p>
Before we can understand how and when to use <code>dojo.hitch</code> and <code>dojo.partial</code>, we must first understand the problems they solve. One of the most misunderstood concepts in JavaScript is embodied in the simple, frequently-asked question, "What is <code>this</code>"? Normally, in object-oriented programming, when one of an object's methods is invoked, we expect 'this' to be that object. The answer is more subtle in JavaScript however; to get firmly to grips with it we need to understand <em>execution contexts</em>.
</p>

<h4>Execution Contexts in JavaScript</h4>
<p>
Whenever a function is invoked in JavaScript, an execution context is created (see
<a href="http://blog.tuenti.com/dev/functions-and-execution-contexts-in-javascript-2/">this article from Tuenti</a>
for some gruesome details).  This context is created with the following process:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>arguments</strong> object is created;</li>
<li>The function's <strong>scope</strong> is created;</li>
<li><strong>Variables</strong> for the function are instantiated;</li>
<li>The <strong><em>this</em></strong> property (for the context itself) is created.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <strong><em>this</em></strong> property is where most developers get confused; it is a reference
<em>to the object that is considered the context (or scope) of the function's invocation</em>.  Understanding this
(no pun intended) is the key to understanding how JavaScript works&mdash;because in JavaScript, the
actual context in which a function is executed is determined <em>when the function is invoked</em>.
</p>
<div class="proTip"><p>Scope is often confusing in JavaScript - on the one hand, it can mean the object under which something is invoked (or executed), and on the other it is the object under which something is defined. The latter is referred to as lexical scope, and is considered the true scope in JavaScript. Lexical scoping enables such programming techniques as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">closures</a>; for reference, take a look at this <a href="http://www.jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/">excellent article</a> by Richard Cornford.</p>

<p>The idea of scope during invocation is known as the execution context in JavaScript</p></div>
<p></p>

<p>
Let's take a common example.  Say we have an object, and one of the methods in that object is intended
to be used as an event handler for a number of nodes in a document.  We might define it like so:
</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
var myObject = {
	foo: "bar",
	myHandler: function(evt){
		//	this is very contrived but will do.
		alert("The value of 'foo' is " + this.foo);
	}
};

//	later on in the script:
dojo.query(".myNodes").forEach(function(node){
	node.onclick = myObject.myHandler;
});
</pre>
<a class="demoBtn demo" href="demo/demo.html">View Demo</a>
<p>
When someone clicks on any node with the CSS class "myNodes", you might expect the above function
definition to show a JavaScript alert box saying "The value of 'foo' is bar"; however, because of the way we
attached the handler reference to each node we'll instead get <strong>The value of 'foo' is undefined</strong>.
The reason why is because <em>myObject.myHandler</em> is being executed <strong><em>in the context
of the node we attached it to</em></strong>, and <strong>NOT</strong> in the context of <em>myObject</em>.
In other words, the JavaScript interpreter thinks that the <em>this</em> keyword in our handler function
refers to <em>node we set the reference to</em>, and <strong>not</strong> <em>myObject</em>.
</p>
<div class="proTip">
<p>
If you find that confusing, remember that the reason why is because Function objects, like any other
non-primitive type in JavaScript, are passed <em>by reference</em> and not by value; in our example above,
we are setting the <em>onclick</em> method of a node to be a reference directly to <em>myObject.myHandler</em>.
</p>
<p>
Remember: functions in JavaScript are <em>first-order objects</em>, and can be treated just like any
other object in JavaScript&mdash;including being passed to another function as an argument.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Switching execution contexts with <code>.apply</code> and <code>.call</code></h4>
<p>
Because of the ability for JavaScript to define execution contexts when a function is invoked, the
language provides a way of changing contexts&mdash;i.e., the meaning of <em>this</em>&mdash;on the
fly through <code>Function.apply</code> and <code>Function.call</code>.  Simply put, both methods
allow you to execute a function within a passed object as its context.  For example, if we wanted
to ensure that our contrived handler above was executed in the context of <em>myObject</em>, we'd
wrap our reference using the <code>Function.call</code> method, like so:
</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
dojo.query(".myNodes").forEach(function(node){
	node.onclick = function(evt){
		return myObject.myHandler.call(myObject, evt);
	};
});
</pre>
<a class="demoBtn demo" href="demo/call.html">View Demo</a>
<div class="proTip">
<p>
In most examples on the Intertubes&trade;, <code>Function.apply</code> is used, and usually
passed the <em>arguments</em> object from the outer function.  However, when the <em>arguments</em>
to a function are known in advance we recommend the use of <em>call</em>; there is a slight
performance gain when the JavaScript interpreter does not have to access the <em>arguments</em>
object directly.
</p>
<p>
We could have also called <em>myObject.myHandler</em> directly, but used the <code>.call</code>
form to demonstrate setting the context of <em>myHandler</em> on-the-fly.
</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>
Now that we've reviewed the basics of execution context in JavaScript, let's see how
the Dojo Toolkit simplifies this process through <code>dojo.hitch</code>.
</p>
<h3>Binding execution context with <code>dojo.hitch</code></h3>
<p>
The Dojo Toolkit provides a way of simplifying context binding with functions via the workhorse
<a href="/api/dojo#dojo.hitch"><code>dojo.hitch</code></a>.  To put it simply, <code>dojo.hitch</code>
creates a <em>new</em> Function object that is bound (or hitched, hence the name) to a specific
context, which you can then invoke safely&mdash;without ever worrying if the context has
changed.  Using <code>dojo.hitch</code> is simple:
</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
var foo = "bar"
var myFunction = function(){
	return this.foo;
};
var myObject = { foo: "baz" };

// later on in your application
var boundFunction = dojo.hitch(myObject, myFunction);

// the first value will be "bar", the second will be "baz";
// the third will still be "bar".
myFunction();		// "bar"
boundFunction();	// "baz"
myFunction();		// "bar"
</pre>
<a class="demoBtn demo" href="demo/hitch.html">View Demo</a>
<p>
As you can see, <code>dojo.hitch</code> ensures that a particular function&mdash;<em>bound</em> to
a specific execution context&mdash;will <em>always</em> be invoked without fear of having that
context be switched at run-time.
</p>
<h3>The <em>arguments</em> object</h3>
<p>
Remember when we explained the process by which an execution context is created?  The very first
step is to create the <em>arguments</em> object.  This object is an Array-like object, with an
ordered list of values that have been passed to a function.  In addition, in the third step of
creating a context all variables for the function are created&mdash;including any named arguments,
so that these values can be accessed directly by name as if they were just another variable in the
function body.
</p>
<p class="proTip">
Keep in mind that the <em>arguments</em> object is not a true Array object in JavaScript; though
it shares some of the same aspects (such as members accessible via numbers and a <em>length</em>
property), it is considered read-only&mdash;which means that none of the other Array methods
(such as <code>Array.prototype.slice</code>) are available.
</p>
<p>
When a function is defined, the <em>signature</em> of the function becomes fixed.  One cannot add
or remove named arguments without redefining the function itself.  This can become a problem at times,
particularly when you are in need of matching a function signature (say, for a pre-defined handler in
a library such as the Dojo Toolkit) without actually copying or rewriting the original function.  The
Dojo Toolkit provides a simple way of accomplishing this through the method <code>dojo.partial</code>.
</p>
<h3>Changing function signatures with <code>dojo.partial</code></h3>
<p>
A problem a developer might face is having a function with multiple arguments
being used where a smaller set of arguments is required.  For example, say we have a function
that takes 4 arguments, like so (we'll be using <code>dojo.data</code> for the example):
</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
var putValue = function(store, item, attr, value){
	return store.setValue(item, attr, value);
}
</pre>
<p>
...but somewhere else in your application, a different developer (or a library) has written a set of objects
that will call a similar handler with only <em>3</em> arguments:
</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
someObject.setValueHandler = function(item, attr, value){
	//	placeholder function to be overridden
};
</pre>
<p>
With <code>dojo.partial</code>, you can create a new (unbound) function <em>with preset values
for arguments</em> (or <em>bound</em> arguments).  To complete our example above, we'd want to
"preset" the <em>store</em> argument with a reference to a specific store and then set
<code>someObject.setValueHandler</code> to a reference of our <em>partial</em> function
(hence the name), like so:
</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
// assuming we have a dojo.data store called "myStore"

// our function
var putValue = function(store, item, attr, value){
	return store.setValue(item, attr, value);
}

// ...
// their function signature
someObject.setValueHandler = function(item, attr, value){
	//	placeholder function to be overridden
};

// ...
// our solution using dojo.partial
someObject.setValueHandler = dojo.partial(putValue, myStore);

// ...
// somewhere in the application when setHandler is invoked,
// our putValue function will already have the "store" arg
// set to a reference to "myStore"
someObject.setValueHandler(someItem, "foo", "bar");
</pre>
<a class="demoBtn demo" href="demo/partial.html">View Demo</a>
<p>
The above can be confusing, so let's break down what is happening:
</p>
<ol>
<li>We define our putValue function to take 4 arguments;</li>
<li>We find out that the setValueHandler was only designed to take <em>3</em> arguments, and
(for the sake of the example) we cannot change that;</li>
<li>We create a <em>new</em> function out of <em>putValue</em> that has the first
argument&mdash;<em>store</em>&mdash;<strong>preset</strong> to be <em>myStore</em>;</li>
<li>The new <em>partial</em> function is then called by other mechanisms with the
<em>3</em> arguments passed, but our <em>partial</em> function already has <em>myStore</em>
set to be the first argument, no matter what.</li>
</ol>
<p>
An important thing to note is that unlike <code>dojo.hitch</code>, <code>dojo.partial</code>
<strong>does not preset the execution context for the returned partial function</strong>.  In
other words, the meaning of the <em>this</em> keyword can change, depending on how you've used
the new partial function.
</p>
<p class="proTip">
One interesting technique you could do with <code>dojo.partial</code>, should you be so inclined,
is to preset a reference to an object you would like access to <em>beforehand</em> so that you
get the best of both worlds&mdash;by letting the execution context change but having a bound
reference via the function's arguments.
</p>
<h3>Getting the best of <code>hitch</code> and <code>partial</code> together</h3>
<p>
What if you wanted the best of what <code>hitch</code> does (forcing an execution context) with
the best of what <code>partial</code> does (presetting arguments)?  Well, it turns out that
<code>dojo.hitch</code> was designed to do just that&mdash;you can include any number of values
<em>after</em> the context and method arguments, and <code>dojo.hitch</code> will assemble
the new function with both a bound context and preset arguments.  Let's take a similar example
to the above:
</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
someObject.setValueHandler = dojo.hitch(someObject, putValue, myStore);

// ...
// later on in the application, the setHandler is invoked
// again--this time in the context of someObject
someObject.setValueHandler(someItem, "foo", "bar");
</pre>
<p class="proTip">
<code>hitch</code> and <code>partial</code> are a gateway to a technique known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"><em>functional programming</em></a>;
the Dojo Toolkit offers a lot more functional programming techniques through the
<a href="/api/dojox/lang/functional">dojox.lang.functional</a> namespace, which we encourage
you to take a look at.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
In this tutorial, we've reviewed the JavaScript Function object&mdash;including the invocation
process when a function is called. We then introduced <code>dojo.hitch</code>, which allows
you to bind a function to a specific execution context.  From there, we learned how to
bind <em>arguments</em> to a function using <code>dojo.partial</code>&mdash;and then showed how
you can bind both context and arguments using <code>dojo.hitch</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>dojo.hitch</code> is particularly useful with event-driven programming techniques
(i.e. callback-based programming), as it allows you to preset the execution context of
a function without fear of changing the meaning of the <em>this</em> keyword.
