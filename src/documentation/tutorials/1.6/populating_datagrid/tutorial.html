<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Although displaying your data in the right order and in a manner that makes sense to the user is important, it might not always be enough. Sometimes the data you get won't be formatted for optimum display, and will need tailored to make it more readable. DataGrid can help with this...but first, let's take a look at a point we glossed over in the first tutorial: how to get data into your grid.</p>

<h3>Retrieving Data From a Store</h3>
<p>The first thing we'll be doing is creating a store. We'll be using <code>dojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore</code>, but any store conforming to Dojo's data API will work. Since the data API was discussed in <a href="../dojo_data">an earlier tutorial</a> we won't be covering it here, except to say that the hall of fame batting statistics we used from our last tutorial are loaded by passing the URL of our JSON file to the <code>url</code> parameter of the store.</p>
<p class="proTip"><code>dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore</code> and <code>dojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore</code> were originally intended only as reference implementations. For a more performant store, consider using <code>dojox.data.JsonRestStore</code>.</p>
<p>At this point, there are two ways to access the data in the store; the first is letting the DataGrid query the store for you. To do this, we can pass three parameters to the DataGrid constructor:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>store</code>: The data store.</li>
	<li><code>query</code>: The query to pass to the store. The syntax will depend on the store being used.</li>
	<li><code>queryOptions</code>: Options to pass to the store during querying. The options will depend on the store being used, and is not required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we want every record, we'll be passing <code>{ id: "*" }</code> to the <code>dojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush:js;">
store = new dojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore({
	url: "hof-batting.json"
});
grid = new dojox.grid.DataGrid({
	store: store,
	query: { id: "*" },
	structure: [
		{ name: "First Name", field: "first", width: "25%" },
		{ name: "Last Name", field: "last", width: "25%" },
		{ name: "G", field: "totalG", width: "10%" },
		{ name: "AB", field: "totalAB", width: "10%" },
		{ name: "R", field: "totalR", width: "10%" },
		{ name: "H", field: "totalH", width: "10%" },
		{ name: "RBI", field: "totalRBI", width: "10%" }
	]
}, "grid");
grid.startup();
</pre>

<p>Another way to populate your grid is to manually fetch the data you want from the store. Instead of giving the DataGrid a <code>query</code> parameter, you would pass it the array of items from the store as an <code>items</code> parameter:</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
store = new dojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore({
	url: "hof-batting.json"
});
store.fetch({
	query: { id: "*" },
	onComplete: function(items){
		grid = new dojox.grid.DataGrid({
			store: store,
			items: items,
			structure: [
				{ name: "First Name", field: "first", width: "25%" },
				{ name: "Last Name", field: "last", width: "25%" },
				{ name: "G", field: "totalG", width: "10%" },
				{ name: "AB", field: "totalAB", width: "10%" },
				{ name: "R", field: "totalR", width: "10%" },
				{ name: "H", field: "totalH", width: "10%" },
				{ name: "RBI", field: "totalRBI", width: "10%" }
			]
		}, "grid");

		grid.startup();
	}
});
</pre>

<p class="proTip">Each population method has its advantages: using a <code>query</code> will allow the grid to use the store's sorting, but using <code>items</code> will provide faster rendering since the store isn't queried for each page of data. It's up to you to decide which method fits your application the best.</p>

<h3>Formatting Data</h3>
<p>Now that we have data in our grid, we need to format some of it. Besides the class and style properties talked about in the last tutorial, there are two more properties for formatting data: <code>formatter</code> and <code>get</code>. <code>formatter</code> takes a function that will be called with 3 arguments: the data from the field specified for this cell, the row index, and the reference to the cell definition object. The return value of this function will be used as the data for the cell:</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
{
	name: "G", field: "totalG", width: "10%",
	formatter: function(games){
		return games + " <em>games</em>";
	}
},
</pre>
<p>Another way to format your data is using the <code>fields</code> property of a cell definition to pass data from multiple fields as an array to your formatter function. This can be used, for instance, to concatenate a player's first and last names:</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
{
	name: "Name", fields: ["first", "last"], width: "30%",
	formatter: function(fields){
		var first = fields[0],
			last = fields[1];

		return last + ", " + first;
	}
},
</pre>
<p>If you need access to multiple values of a record, another option is to pass the string <code>"_item"</code> to the cell definition's <code>field</code> property. This will tell the DataGrid to pass the data object assocciated with the record for the row as the first argument of your formatter function:</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
{
	name: "Batting Average", field: "_item", width: "10%",
	formatter: function(item, rowIndex, cell){
		var store = cell.grid.store,
			ba = store.getValue(item, "totalH") / store.getValue(item, "totalAB");

		// round to three digits
		return dojox.math.round(ba, 3);
	}
},
</pre>
<p>One last approach to formatting data is to separate the calculation from the formatting. By passing a function to the <code>get</code> property of the cell definition, the DataGrid will call this function in order to fetch the data out of the item. The DataGrid will pass the <code>get</code> function 2 arguments: the row index of the record and the data item associated with the record. For large calculations, this is the preferred option:</p>
<pre class="brush: js;">
{
	name: "Slugging %", width: "10%",
	get: function(rowIndex, item){
		if(!item){
			return;
		}
		// |this| is the cell object
		var store = this.grid.store,
			hits = store.getValue(item, "totalH"),
			doubles = store.getValue(item, "total2B"),
			triples = store.getValue(item, "total3B"),
			homeruns = store.getValue(item, "totalHR"),
			total_bases = hits + doubles + (triples * 2) + (homeruns * 3),
			at_bats = store.getValue(item, "totalAB");

		return total_bases / at_bats;
	},
	formatter: function(slugging){
		// round to three digits
		return dojox.math.round(slugging, 3);
	}
}
</pre>

<p class="proTip">By using <code>get</code>, <code>fields</code>, or <code>field</code> set to <code>"_item"</code>, the DataGrid will not be able to sort your data. If you need sorting and advanced calculations client-side, you will need to transform the data before it gets to your store.</code>

<h3>DataGrid as a View</h3>
<p>One very important point should be made before concluding this tutorial: the DataGrid is simply a <em>view</em> of a dojo.data store. This means the DataGrid will react to changes in the store (row addition or deletion, and record field updates) if the store supports the notification API of dojo.data, and it will sort the data according to the rules of the store you're using. However, it is not designed to do sorting apart from the store. This means that if formatting your data will change the sort order, the DataGrid won't notice the formatted changes.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Formatting data is a big key to the puzzle of displaying tabular data so a user can easily use your grid. By providing formatting functions to your cell definitions, you will have even more control over how your data will appear in your grid. In the next tutorial, we will look at how the DataGrid exposes methods and events for controlling how users can interact with your grid.</p>
