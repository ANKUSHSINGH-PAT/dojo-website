A stylesheet is the optimum place for defining how something looks, so one way to make dynamic or visual changes is to offer up classes on those elements. Other times, we need to work more directly on a node's style to set dynamic properties that would be impossible in a static stylesheet. Dojo makes it simple to work both ways.
