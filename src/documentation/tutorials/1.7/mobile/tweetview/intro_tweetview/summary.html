The first article in our series, <a href="/documentation/tutorials/1.7/mobile/tweetview/getting_started">Getting Started with dojox/mobile</a>, detailed the fundamental concepts and usage of the Dojo Toolkit's <code>dojox/mobile</code> library.  In the remaining posts in this series, we'll embark on creating our own fully functional <code>dojox/mobile</code> web application called TweetView.  This post will focus on familiarizing you with what TweetView is, what we want it to do, and we'll get started on building the mobile application's HTML and CSS layout.
