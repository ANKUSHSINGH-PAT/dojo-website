	In the previous post, <a href="/documentation/tutorials/1.8/mobile/tweetview/starting_tweetview/">Getting Started with TweetView:  Tweets and Mentions</a>, we solidified our mobile application's file structure, reviewed TweetView's goals, and created the Tweets and Mentions views by coding <code>tweetview/_ViewMixin</code> and <code>tweetview/TweetView</code>.  This tutorial will focus specifically on the "Settings" view of our application:  dependencies for the class, how the Settings view ties into the Tweet and Mention views, and coding the Settings view itself.
