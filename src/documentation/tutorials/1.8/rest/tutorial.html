<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>In a lot of ways, REST and RESTful has become the default architecture for modern web applications.  But, the first
	thing to understand about REST and RESTful services is that REST isn't a standard, but more of a methodology. There
	are many server side RESTful services that already behave in a fashion that is compatible with Dojo and DojoX JSON
	REST data stores.  This tutorial though is going to explain how they work and what in case you wanted to build your
	own server side implementation, or understand better what needs to happen when integrating to a RESTful service.</p>

<p>Before you get too far in the tutorial, you will need some grounding in other key concepts within the toolkit.  If
	you aren't familiar with these other areas, then it would be best to read these tutorials first:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="../ajax">Ajax with dojo/request</a></li>
	<li><a href="../deferreds">Getting Started with Deferreds</a></li>
	<li><a href="../promises">Dojo Deferreds and Promises</a></li>
	<li><a href="../intro_dojo_store">Dojo Object Store</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The examples in this tutorial focus on the interface between the client and server.  In order to be practical though
	the RESTful service would need to be able to store and persist the data, usually in some sort of database or data
	store.  The details of interfacing with a data store is beyond the scope of this tutorial and highly conditional
	upon what sort of data you need to serve for your application.</p>

<h3>Overview of REST</h3>

<p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer and was introduced and defined by Roy Fielding in 2000.  He indicated
	that there should be six key constraints on RESTful services:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Client-Server</dt>
	<dd>A uniform interface and separation of concerns between the client and server so that code is more portable</dd>
	<dt>Stateless</dt>
	<dd>No client context should be stored on the server in between requests</dd>
	<dt>Cacheable</dt>
	<dd>The server should be explicit about if the response is cacheable or not.</dd>
	<dt>Layered System</dt>
	<dd>The client cannot tell if it is connected directly to the end server or some other intermediary.</dd>
	<dt>Code on Demand (Optional)</dt>
	<dd>The server can extend or augment the client temporarily by sending code to the client. <em>Note:</em> This is
		not something that is designed into the existing Dojo JSON REST data stores.</dd>
	<dt>Uniform Interface</dt>
	<dd>A uniform interface simplifies and decouples the architecture, which is based on the the HTTP protocol
		standards</dd>
</dl>

<p>A REST request/response has the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>A URI &mdash;</strong> such as: <code>http://example.com/resources/</code>.</li>
	<li><strong>Data &mdash;</strong> such as an encoded multi-part form data or JSON.</li>
	<li><strong>HTTP Method &mdash;</strong> with the main four being <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>,
		<code>POST</code> and <code>DELETE</code>.</li>
	<li><strong>Must be Hyper-Text Driven &mdash;</strong> several REST APIs put artificial constraints on how
		resources are identified and adding artificial semantics.  Roy Fielding
		<a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven" target="_blank">discusses
			here</a> how this is very anti-REST.  Ultimately REST should be as "open-structured" as browsing
			the web, but for data.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two types of URIs in RESTful services.  There are <em>Collection URIs</em> which would represent a
	collection of objects (e.g. <code>http://example.com/books/</code> might return a set of data represent a collection
	of books).  Then there are <em>Element URIs</em> which represent a specific element of a collection (e.g.
	<code>http://example.com/books/1/</code> might return a book that is identified by <code>1</code>).  These are then
	designed to be compounded, much like a structure of a website, to navigate deeper into the data (e.g.
	<code>http://example.com/books/1/pages/</code> might return a collection of pages for a book and
	<code>http://example.com/books/1/pages/1/</code> might return the first page).</p>

<p>When the URIs are then combined with an HTTP method/verb, they provide meaning about what actions is being
	performed:</p>

<table class="options">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>URI Type</th>
			<th><code>GET</code></th>
			<th><code>PUT</code></th>
			<th><code>POST</code></th>
			<th><code>DELETE</code></th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Collection</td>
			<td>Return a list of resources that are part of the collection.</td>
			<td>Replace the entire collection with the one supplied.</td>
			<td>Create a new entry in the collection.  A new Element URI is created and usually returned in the
				response.</td>
			<td>Delete the entire collection.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Element</td>
			<td>Return a representation of the identified element.</td>
			<td>Replace the identified element of the collection with the supplied one, or if it doesn't exist, create
				it.</td>
			<td>Not generally used, but the supplied data is meant to be a collection in its own right and the data
				should be created as a collection identified by the element.</td>
			<td>Delete the identified element.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Client Side Overview</h3>

<p>Before we get into the details of what is required to implement a server side JSON RESTful data server, let's cover
	off the client side quickly first.  <code>dojo/store/JsonRest</code> is a straight forward and lightweight
	implementation of Dojo Object Store API. Using it against a server-side RESTful service is fairly simple.  Usually
	you simply set the <code>target</code> attribute to the URI of the collection you want the store to represent.
	For example, if I wanted to connect to a RESTful collection of books, I would do something like this:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
require(["dojo/store/JsonRest", "dojo/when"], function(JsonRest, when){
	// Create a new store that connects to the "books" collection
	var bookStore = new JsonRest({
		target: "/books"
	});

	// Get a book from the store ID'ed by "1" and log the returned
	// value to the console.
	when(bookStore.get(1)).then(function(book){
		console.log(book);
	});
});
</pre>

<p class="proTip">In the example above <code>dojo/when</code> is used to "wrap" the return value of the of the
	<code>.get()</code> to ensure it is a promise.  The <code>dojo/store/JsonRest</code> always returns a promise, but
	if you are writing code that you want to be "generic" no matter what store you are using, using
	<code>dojo/when</code> ensures the code would work with a store that doesn't always return a promise (e.g. <code>
	dojo/store/Memory</code>).</p>

<p>As of Dojo 1.8 all of the widgets that are part of the Dijit project are Dojo Object Store API aware, which means
	that you can use an instance of <code>dojo/store/JsonRest</code> to drive your data aware Dijits.  Some of the
	DojoX widgets are Dojo Object Store API aware, but if they are not, you can use the
	<code>dojo/data/ObjectStore</code> to wrap a <code>dojo/store/JsonRest</code> instance and provide the legacy Dojo
	Data API to the widget.</p>

<p class="proTip">For more information on the <code>dojo/data/ObjectStore</code> can be found in the
	<a href="/reference-guide/1.8/dojo/data/ObjectStore.html" target="_blank">Reference Guide</a>.</p>

<p class="proTip">There is also the legacy <code>dojox/data/JsonRestStore</code>.  It was built around the legacy Dojo
	Data API and more information can be found in the <a href="/reference-guide/1.8/dojox/data/JsonRestStore.html"
	target="_blank">Reference Guide</a>.</p>

<h3>The Basics</h3>

<p>In the overview of REST above, we discussed the basics of RESTful services.  To implement them, you simply need to
	create a service service that returns the appropriate JSON data that you want to represent.  It is very difficult
	to cover off every server side technology, but I will provide examples using <a href="http://nodejs.org/"
	target="_blank">NodeJS</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> and will also provide
	examples in PHP.  There are countless other frameworks and APIs that would implement the basics as well.</p>

<p>So back to our book example above, if we wanted to serve up a collection of books in a service, we might want have a
	collection that looked like this, represented in JSON:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
[
	{ "id": 1, "title": "A Brave New World", "author": "Aldous Huxley", "price": 1.53 },
	{ "id": 2, "title": "Fahrenheit 451", "author": "Ray Bradbury", "price": 2.17 },
	{ "id": 3, "title": "Neuromancer", "author": "William Gibson", "price": 4.92 },
	{ "id": 4, "title": "A Scanner Darkley", "author": "Philip K. Dick", "price": 3.33 }
]
</pre>

<p>The first thing you should notice is that there is an ID field as part of the JSON structure.  In a collection, the
	client store is expecting to be able to figure out how to identify and reference the individual elements of the
	collection.  The store defaults to <code>id</code> but this can be changed by setting the <code>idProperty</code>
	property of the store:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
require(["dojo/store/JsonRest"], function(JsonRest){
	// Create a new store, that targets the books collection, but identifies
	// each book by "someId"
	var bookStore = new JsonRest({
		target: "/books",
		idProperty: "someId"
	});
});
</pre>

<p>Now we want to serve up our collection of books on the <code>/books/</code> URI on our server. In NodeJS with Express
	it would look like this:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
// The collection of books
var books = [
		{ id: 1, title: "A Brave New World", author: "Aldous Huxley", price: 1.53 },
		{ id: 2, title: "Fahrenheit 451", author: "Ray Bradbury", price: 2.17 },
		{ id: 3, title: "Neuromancer", author: "William Gibson", price: 4.92 },
		{ id: 4, title: "A Scanner Darkley", author: "Philip K. Dick", price: 3.33 }
	];
var express = require("express"), // require in the Express module
	app = express(); // create a new Express application

// When the /books URL is accessed, return the JSON representation of the book collection
app.get("/books", function(req, res){
	res.status(200);
	res.json(books);
});

// Start listening on port 80 for requests
app.listen(80);
</pre>

<p>And an example in PHP, I would have a file called <code>books.php</code> and the appropriate server configuration
	to auto-map the <code>php</code> extension:</p>

<pre class="brush:php;">
&lt;?php
	// The collection of books
	$books = array(
		array('id' => 1, 'title' => 'A Brave New World', 'author' => 'Aldous Huxley', 'price' => 1.53),
		array('id' => 2, 'title' => 'Fahrenheit 451', 'author' => 'Ray Bradbury', 'price' => 2.17),
		array('id' => 3, 'title' => 'Neuromancer', 'author' => 'William Gibson', 'price' => 4.92),
		array('id' => 4, 'title' => 'A Scanner Darkley', 'author' => 'Philip K. Dick', 'price' => 3.33)
	);

	// Determine the request method of the request
	$requestMethod = $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];

	// Handle a "GET" request, return the JSON representation of the book collection
	if ($requestMethod == 'GET') {
		header('HTTP/1.1 200 OK');
		header('Content-type: application/json');
		print json_encode($books);
	}
?&gt;
</pre>

<p>Now let's retrieve the collection of books and log it to the console:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
require(["dojo/store/JsonRest", "dojo/when"], function(JsonRest, when){
	// Create a new store pointed at our collection of books
	var bookStore = new JsonRest({
		target: "books/",
	});

	// Request all the books and log the results to the console
	when(bookStore.query()).then(function(results){
		console.log(results);
	});
});
</pre>

<a class="demoBtn demo" href="demo/rest-books.php" target="_blank">View Demo</a>

<p>If we wanted to retrieve an element, we would want to do something like this in Express:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
// The collection of books
var books = [
		{ id: 1, title: "A Brave New World", author: "Aldous Huxley", price: 1.53 },
		{ id: 2, title: "Fahrenheit 451", author: "Ray Bradbury", price: 2.17 },
		{ id: 3, title: "Neuromancer", author: "William Gibson", price: 4.92 },
		{ id: 4, title: "A Scanner Darkley", author: "Philip K. Dick", price: 3.33 }
	];
var express = require("express"), // require in the Express module
	app = express(); // create a new Express application

// Using the router feature of Express allows easy mapping of URIs to code
app.configure(function(){
	app.use(app.router);
});

// Continue to provide the full collection of books
app.get("/books", function(req, res){
	res.status(200);
	res.json(books);
});

// When a client requests "/books/id", it will provide the "id" and look for it
app.get("/books/:id", function(req, res){
	var book;
	books.some(function(b){ // search for the book in the collection
		return book = (b.id == req.params.id) ? b : false;
	});
	if(book){  // if we found the book return it
		res.status(200);
		res.json(book);
	}else{ // oops, we didn't find the book
		res.status(404);
		res.json({ status: 404 });
	}
});

// Start listening for requests on port 80
app.listen(80);
</pre>

<p>And in PHP:</p>

<pre class="brush:php;">
&lt;?php
	// The collection of books
	$books = array(
		array('id' => 1, 'title' => 'A Brave New World', 'author' => 'Aldous Huxley', 'price' => 1.53),
		array('id' => 2, 'title' => 'Fahrenheit 451', 'author' => 'Ray Bradbury', 'price' => 2.17),
		array('id' => 3, 'title' => 'Neuromancer', 'author' => 'William Gibson', 'price' => 4.92),
		array('id' => 4, 'title' => 'A Scanner Darkley', 'author' => 'Philip K. Dick', 'price' => 3.33)
	);

	// Determine the request method
	$requestMethod = $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];
	// Parse the URI
	$uri = explode('?',$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
	// Convert the request path into an array to to allow easier analysis of the URI
	$requestPath = explode('/',preg_replace('/\/$/','',preg_replace('/^.*\/books\/?/','',$uri[0])));

	// If the method is a GET
	if ($requestMethod == 'GET') {
		if ($requestPath[0]) { // There is a request for a specific book
			$found = false;
			foreach ($books as $book) { // Search for the book in the collection
				if ($book['id'] == $requestPath[0]) {
					$found = $book;
				}
			}
			if ($found) { // The book was found, return it to the client
				header('HTTP/1.1 200 OK');
				header('Content-type: application/json');
				print json_encode($found);
			} else { // Ooops, we didn't find the book
				header('HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found');
				header('Content-type: application/json');
				print json_encode(array("status" => 404));
			}
		} else { // The request is for the whole collection
			header('HTTP/1.1 200 OK');
			header('Content-type: application/json');
			print json_encode($books);
		}
	}
?&gt;
</pre>

<p>And then to fetch a specific book and display the results:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
require(["dojo/store/JsonRest", "dojo/dom", "dojo/when", "dojo/json"],
function(JsonRest, dom, when, JSON){
	// Create a new store that is pointed at the collection of books
	var bookStore = new JsonRest({
		target: "books/"
	});

	// Retrieve a book with an ID of "1"
	when(bookStore.get(1)).then(function(results){
		// Display the results in the node identified by "output"
		dom.byId("output").innerHTML = JSON.stringify(results);
	});
});
</pre>

<a class="demoBtn demo" href="demo/rest-book.php" target="_blank">View Demo</a>

<p class="proTip">As you can tell from the examples, writing specifically to deal with a set of data loaded in memory is
	inefficient and can get complicated very quickly.  You can build up your own framework or there are several
	frameworks available for creating RESTful services, likely available in whatever server side language you
	prefer.</p>

<p>The rest of this tutorial is going to focus on the specific of the "Dojo way" of RESTful services, and what other
	considerations you need to make when either implementing an existing server side storage framework or building
	your own.</p>

<h3>Querying</h3>

<p>Just returning all the results in a collection, all the time, is not very practical and one of the fundamental parts
	of the functionality of the client data stores is the ability to query a data store.  The
	<code>dojo/store/JsonRest</code> will take whatever query you provide it and append it to the query string.  It is
	up to both the client and server to understand what these query strings mean.</p>

<p>Again, because RESTful services are a concept and not a standard, there is no specific definition of what the query
	string should entail.  One standard is that the query string is made of up key value pairs that represent a "filter"
	on the data set.  For example, if we only wanted books by "William Gibson" we would do the following:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
require(["dojo/store/JsonRest", "dojo/when"], function(JsonRest, when){
	// A data store pointed at a collection of books
	var bookStore = new JsonRest({
		target: "books/"
	});

	// Querying only the books by William Gibson
	when(bookStore.query("author=William Gibson")).then(function(results){
		console.log(results);
	});
});
</pre>

<p>This will be encoded into a query string and send as part of the requested URI:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml;">
http://example.com/books/?author=William%20Gibson
</pre>

<p>It would be up to the server then to parse that query string and only return the results that match the search
	criteria.</p>

<p class="proTip">It can be very difficult to express complex queries as a query string.  Especially when you have
	advanced queries that including sorting (like discussed below).  Because of this, another Dojo Foundation project
	called <a href="http://persvr.org/" target="_blank">Persevere</a> has developed the
	<a href="https://github.com/persvr/rql" target="_blank">RQL</a> language, which allows the expression of these rich
	queries via a query string.  It can be used both client side and server side to generate and interpret these
	queries.  Some of the concepts in the Dojo Store API are directly influenced by this language.<p>

<h3>Sorting</h3>

<p>One of the needs of a client side is to sort data.  Often times, sorting the data is much more efficient when done
	on the server side, especially when the client side maybe only dealing with a subset of the data at any one time.
	In order to do that, the client data stores support the ability to specify sorting, which in turn is passed to the
	server.</p>

<p>By default, the <code>dojo/store/JsonRest</code> generates functional query strings for the sort object that is
	passed to it.  For example, the following query:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
require(["dojo/store/JsonRest", "dojo/when"], function(JsonRest, when){
	// A data store pointed at a collection of books
	var bookStore = new JsonRest({
		target: "books/"
	});

	// Querying all the books in the store, but with them sorted by title
	when(bookStore.query("", {
		sort: [ { attribute: "title", descending: false } ]
	})).then(function(results){
		console.log(results);
	});
});
</pre>

<p>Would result in the following URI being generated:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml;">
http://example.com/books/?sort(+title)
</pre>

<p>This would indicate to the server store that it would need to sort all the records by title in ascending fashion.</p>

<p>The main reason that the client store formats the query string this way is that it avoids using a key/value parameter
	in the query which might conflict with the attribute names of the actual data structure.  For example, you might
	have a field named <code>sort</code> in the collection.  This is often one of things though that some server side
	frameworks have a difficulty with. The <code>dojo/store/JsonRest</code> solves this by proving a property of
	<code>sortParam</code> to allow you to set a key that will take the value of the sort.  So for example:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
require(["dojo/store/JsonRest", "dojo/when"], function(JsonRest, when){
	// Create a new store, pointed at the books collection and using "sort"
	// as the query parameter to indicate how the results should be sorted.
	var bookStore = new JsonRest({
		target: "books/",
		sortParam: "sort"
	});

	// Query the books, sorted by title and display the results
	when(bookStore.query("", {
		sort: [ { attribute: "title", descending: false } ]
	})).then(function(results){
		console.log(results);
	});
});
</pre>

<p>Would result in the following URI being generated:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml;">
http://example.com/books/?sort=+title
</pre>

<p class="proTip">Just remember, if you use a sort parameter that you give due consideration of how that will affect
	the naming of any keys of your server side object storage.</p>

<h3>Ranges</h3>

<p>Retrieving every object out of a data store likely won't make sense in most cases.  So the Dojo Store API supports
	the concepts of a "start" and a "count" to only retrieve a subset of the objects out of the store.  This allows
	client side code to support the concepts of "lazy loading", "virtual paging" and "infinite scroll".</p>

<p>The <code>dojo/store/JsonRest</code> will request a specific range of items if its query options contain a
	<code>start</code> or <code>count</code> property.  When it then attempts to fetch the collection, it will pass a
	<code>Range</code> and an <code>X-Range</code> header (because Opera blocks the passing of the <code>Range</code>
	header).  It will set the value to a key of <code>name</code> and a value of the <code>start</code> and
	<code>count</code>.  If <code>start</code> is omitted, <code>0</code> will be used and if <code>count</code> is
	omitted or set to <code>Infinity</code> then the end of the range will be empty.  Everything is assumed to be zero
	based.</p>

<p>For example, if I wanted the first ten items of a collection, I would do this:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
when(bookStore.query("", {
	start: 0,
	count: 10
})).then(function(results){
	console.log(results);
});
</pre>

<p>This would result in the following headers being generated and sent to the server with the request:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml;">
GET /books/ HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:80
Accept: application/javascript, application/json
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Range: items=0-9
X-Range: items=0-9
</pre>

<p>It is then the responsibility of the server then to respond with only a subset of the collection identified and the
	number of items in the collection for that particular query.  The server does this by return a
	<code>Content-Range</code> header, set to the value of <code>items</code> with the range of elements out of the
	collection and a total count of all elements that match the query.  For example with the above request that wants
	the first 10 records of the collection, but our previous example that we only have 4 books in our collection,
	we would want to return the following header:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml;">
Content-Range: items 0-3/4
</pre>

<p>The total is then provided in the query results from the store.  Because this can be a promise, we should interact
	with it using <code>dojo/when</code>:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
require(["dojo/store/JsonRest", "dojo/when"], function(JsonRest, when){
	// Create a new store pointed at the "books" collection
	var bookStore = new JsonRest({
		target: "books/"
	});

	// Query the store, starting at the first record and then up to
	// the next 10 records
	var results = bookStore.query("", {
		start: 0,
		count: 10
	});

	// When there is a total count of records, log it to the console
	when(results.total).then(function(totalCount){
		console.log("totalCount: ", totalCount);
		// When the records are returned, log them to the console
		when(results).then(function(items){
			console.log(items);
		});
	});
});
</pre>

<p class="proTip">Many widgets us <code>start</code>, <code>count</code> and <code>total</code> to provide the ability
	to "display" large data sets.  They will use this information, for example, to set the scroll position in a scroll
	box without having to load all the records from the server side data store.</p>

<h3>Adding or Changing Data</h3>

<p>Just retrieving data from a server has it limits.  Often times it is necessary for users to either change or add data
	to the stores.  With RESTful services, adding elements to a collection is done via <code>POST</code> and modifying
	elements is done via <code>PUT</code>.  The Dojo Store API provides to methods, where are <code>.add()</code> and
	<code>.put()</code>.  From an API perspective, they really only differ in the sense that <code>.add()</code> does
	not allow you to overwrite an object with the same ID.</p>

<p>When implemented in the <code>dojo/store/JsonRest</code>, the determination of if it is a <code>PUT</code> or a
	<code>POST</code> is actually determined by if the supplied object has an ID.  It is assumed that new elements will
	not have an ID associated with them and will be assigned by the server, and that the server will handle any conflict
	resolution.</p>

<p>The data payload of the request will be a JSON encoded string of the object supplied in the request.  To access
	this via Express, it would look something like this:<p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
// Our collection of books
var books = [
		{ id: 1, title: "A Brave New World", author: "Aldous Huxley", price: 1.53 },
		{ id: 2, title: "Fahrenheit 451", author: "Ray Bradbury", price: 2.17 },
		{ id: 3, title: "Neuromancer", author: "William Gibson", price: 4.92 },
		{ id: 4, title: "A Scanner Darkley", author: "Philip K. Dick", price: 3.33 }
	],
	maxId = 4; // Out current "max ID" of our collection

var express = require("express"), // Require in express
	app = express();

app.configure(function(){
	// We need to use the bodyParser to get the information posted
	app.use(express.bodyParser());
	// Allows us to route the URIs in a dynamic manner
	app.use(app.router);
});

// When we GET the collection URI, return the collection
app.get("/books", function(req, res){
	res.status(200);
	res.json(books);
});

// When we GET a specific book by ID, return that book
app.get("/books/:id", function(req, res){
	var book;
	books.some(function(b){
		return book = (b.id == req.params.id) ? b : false;
	});
	if(book){
		res.status(200);
		res.json(book);
	}else{
		res.status(404);
		res.json({ status: 404 });
	}
});

// We should be trying to update a book based on ID
app.put("/books/:id", function(req, res){
	var data = request.body, // Read the data by
		bookIdx;
	data.id = request.params.id || data.id; // Allow the URI ID to override any supplied ID
	// Find the book
	books.some(function(b, idx){
		if(b.id == req.params.id){
			bookIdx = idx;
			return true;
		}
	});
	if(bookIdx){
		// If we found the book, update the book in the collection
		books[bookIdx] = data;
		res.status(200);
		res.json(data);
	}else{
		// Book wasn't found
		res.status(404);
		res.json({ status: 404 });
	}
});

// We should be trying to add a book
app.post("/books", function(req, res){
	var data = request.body; // Retrieve the books data
	data.id = maxId++; // Generate a new ID
	books.push(data); // Add it to the collection
	res.header("Location", "/books/" + data.id); // Return a new URI for the book
	res.status(200);
	res.json(data);
});

// Start listening for requests on port 80
app.listen(80);
</pre>

<p>And in PHP:</p>

<pre class="brush:php;">
&lt;?php
	// This allows for us to "store" data temporarily to make it appear to be a persistent data store
	session_start();

	// Checks to see if our sessions variables are available and if not, sets them to their starting values
	if(!isset($_SESSION['books']) || !isset($_SESSION['maxId'])){
		$books = array(
			array('id' => 1, 'title' => 'A Brave New World', 'author' => 'Aldous Huxley', 'price' => 1.53),

		$_SESSION['maxId'] = $maxId;
	} else {
		// Otherwise it will set the local variables to the value of the session variables
		$books = $_SESSION['books'];
		$maxId = $_SESSION['maxId'];
	}

	// Gather some informatin about the request.
	$requestMethod = $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];
	$uri = explode('?',$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
	// Generates an array for the requested path, to make it easier to branch based on the requested URI
	$requestPath = explode('/',preg_replace('/\/$/','',preg_replace('/^.*\/books\/?/','',$uri[0])));

?&gt;
</pre>

<p>You can see in the examples above, when calling <code>POST</code> to the collection URI, it is standard practice to
	return a <code>Location</code> header that points to the the URI of the newly created ID.</p>

<p>If we wanted to interact with this store, we would then want to do something like this:</p>

<pre class="brush:js;">
require(["dojo/store/JsonRest", "dojo/when", "dojo/dom",
	"dojo/dom-attr", "dojo/json", "dojo/on", "dojo/domReady!"],
function(JsonRest, when, dom, attr, JSON, on){
	// Create a new store, pointed at the "books" collection
	var bookStore = new JsonRest({
		target: "books/"
	});

	on(dom.byId("b1"), "click", function(e){
		// When "b1" is clicked, retrieve Book with an ID of 1
		when(bookStore.get(1)).then(function(book){
			// Output the object representation to the "o1" node in the
			// document
			dom.byId("o1").innerHTML = JSON.stringify(book);
			// Change the name of the author
			book.author = "Huxley, Aldous";
			// "put" the changed book back on the server
			when(bookStore.put(book)).then(function(result){
				// display the "updated" book
				dom.byId("o2").innerHTML = JSON.stringify(result);
				attr.remove("b2", "disabled");
			});
		});
	});

	on(dom.byId("b2"), "click", function(e){
		// When "b2" is clicked, add a book to the store
		when(bookStore.add({
			title: "Catcher in the Rye",
			author: "J. D. Salinger",
			price: 0.98
		})).then(function(){
			// Display the returned book, once added to the server.
			// The server added an ID to the book
			dom.byId("o3").innerHTML = "";
			bookStore.query().forEach(function(book){
				dom.byId("o3").innerHTML += JSON.stringify(book) + "\n";
			});
		})
	});

	// The buttons were added "disabled" for demo purposes, so now that
	// we are ready, we can enable the first one.
	attr.remove("b1", "disabled");

});
</pre>

<p class="proTip">The observant among you will realise that the PHP example is using session storage to persist the
	data between requests and that the Express example is simply keeping the data in memory.  This isn't very practical
	in real life (or even desirable), but it gives you an idea of what you need to do.  You would want to use some sort
	of persistent server side data store.  The demos here are going against the PHP version, since that is what is
	currently supported on our web servers.</p>

<p class="proTip">Notice how, instead of using <code>dojo/when</code> with the <code>query()</code> a
	<code>bookStore.query().forEach()</code> was used.  A <code>query()</code> returns a
	<code>dojo/store/util/QueryResults</code> object, which contains a set of functions to use on the results of the
	query (<code>forEach()</code>, <code>filter()</code> and <code>map()</code>).  The benefit is that if the
	<code>query()</code> is returning a promise, the callbacks for the functions will not be called until all the
	promises are resolved.</p>

<h3>Caching, Performance and Race Conditions</h3>

<p>On of the common challenges with interacting with a server side store is ensuring that data is cached where possible
	to increase performance and there are mechanisms to assist in dealing with conflicts when they arise.</p>

<p>The <code>dojo/store/JsonRest</code> fully utilises the power of HTTP 1.1 and browser user agent.  This means you
	need to understand how these features can affect things on the server and whatever framework you are working with.
	Because the store utilises the XHR system of the browser it is running on, the cache headers supplied by the
	server will be respected, and if you want to increase the performance, ensure that your cache headers represent
	the reality of what can actually be cached.</p>

<p>To help deal with race conditions, when a <code>put()</code> is called, the store will set the
	<code>If-Match: *</code> header if the <code>options.overwrite</code> is <code>true</code> and
	<code>If-None-Match: *</code> if <code>options.overwrite</code> is <code>false</code>.  This helps the server be
	able to resolve conflicts when the <code>ETag</code> of the resource conflicts with the current version on the
	server.</p>

<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<p>JSON has some "challenges" when using structured data that references each other data, especially when that data
	may not have been loaded from the server yet.  In order to deal with these issues, there is a JSON referencing
	library that is part of the DojoX project.  <a href="/reference-guide/1.8/dojox/json/ref.html" target="_blank">
	<code>dojox/json/ref</code></a> is a module that provides this ability to deal with JSON referencing.</p>

<p>Just like referencing is a challenge, sometimes lacking a schema for JSON can be problematic, especially when
	validating data structures.  DojoX provides another module that implements JSON Schema called
	<a href="/reference-guide/1.8/dojox/json/schema.html" target="_blank"><code>dojox/json/schema</code></a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Hopefully this tutorial has given you a good overview of how JSON RESTful services work in Dojo and how you might
	get started creating a server side implementation.  This might have also given you a better understanding of how
	your server side framework might be working and any of the challenges you might encounter in integrating the client
	side and the server side.</p>

<p>If you want the source code to the final PHP example, you can download it as a <a href="demo/books.php.zip">ZIP
	file</a>. You will need a web server that supports PHP available to run the file.  You can download the NodeJS
	example as a <a href="demo/books.js.zip">ZIP file</a> as well.  You will need NodeJS 0.6 or later and Express 3 or
	later installed.</p>

<p>Like most new things, the best thing to do is experiment a little and see how things actually are working.
	Good luck.</p>
