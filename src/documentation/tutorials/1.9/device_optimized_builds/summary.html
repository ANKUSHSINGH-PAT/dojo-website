Dojo now uses the popular <code>has()</code> pattern for feature detection in
combination with a <code>has()</code>-aware build system. While it is easy enough
to write feature detection tests with ad-hoc JavaScript expressions, the
<code>has()</code> pattern defines a specific syntax such that the build system
can detect these feature-based branches, and one can create application builds
that are highly optimized for specific devices, with known feature shims factored out.
