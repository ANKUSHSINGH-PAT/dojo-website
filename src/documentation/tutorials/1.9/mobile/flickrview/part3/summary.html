In the previous part, <a href="/documentation/tutorials/1.9/mobile/flickrview/part2" target="_blank">Developing a Dojo
Mobile Application</a>, we built the general layout template and came up with a mockup of the application. This part
will focus on updating the mockup to dynamically get data and display feeds from Flickr. You will learn how to
initiate, get response and handle error from a JSON request, use a progress indicator while waiting for the server to
respond, dynamically populate a list with ListItems, use a basic HTML template to create ListItems and format a date
according to a specific locale. Are you ready? Let's go!
