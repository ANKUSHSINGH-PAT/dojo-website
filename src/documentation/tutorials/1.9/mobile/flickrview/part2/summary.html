The first article in our series, <a href="/documentation/tutorials/1.9/mobile/flickrview/part1" target="_blank">
Getting Started with Dojo Mobile</a>, detailed the fundamental concepts and usage of the Dojo Toolkit's dojox/mobile
library. In the remaining posts in this series, we'll embark on creating our own fully functional Dojo Mobile web
application called <strong>FlickrView</strong>. This post will focus on familiarizing you with what FlickrView is,
what we want it to do, and we'll get started on building the mobile application's HTML and CSS layout.
