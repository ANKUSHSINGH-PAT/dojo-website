Util
====

The util/ directory is different than dojo/dijit/dojox in that it doesn't contain JavaScript code that accessed directly from web pages.   Rather, it contains utility scripts as listed below.

:ref:`Dojo Build System <build/index>`
--------------------------------------

:ref:`The Dojo build system <build/index>` is used to create efficient optimized packages of JavaScript and CSS, customized for a given application or website. You can take advantage of this powerful tool to help structure your development and speed up your applications.

See also the documentation on :ref:`custom builds <quickstart/custom-builds>`, about how to make optimized builds based on which dojo modules you are using.


:ref:`ShrinkSafe <util/shrinksafe/index>`
-----------------------------------------

:ref:`ShrinkSafe <util/shrinksafe/index>` is a standalone utility for compressing JavaScript,
used by the Dojo Build System as an optional compression step, though can be used on individual files manually.

DOH
---
:ref:`DOH <util/doh>` is the test harness used by dojo, similar to JUnit.

The util/doh/ directory also contains :ref:`DOH Robot <util/dohrobot>`, an API used in conjunction with DOH for automated keyboard/mouse testing.

The Dojo API doc system
-----------------------

Dojo uses a custom inline comment syntax which produces well structured xml,
and powers the official `API Docs <http://dojotoolkit.org/api/>`_ .

The doc system is powered by js-doc-parse.    See https://github.com/wkeese/api-viewer/blob/master/README.rst
for documentation.

Previously, it was powered by the :ref:`doctools <util/doctools>` directory.
However, this is now deprecated and will be removed in 2.0.

:ref:`Checkstyle <util/checkstyle>`
-----------------------------------

:ref:`Checkstyle <util/checkstyle>` is a standalone utility for checking JavaScript files for violations of
the Dojo style guide. Also includes an online tool for automatically fixing the majority of style guide violations.


Migration
-----------
The migration directory contains scripts for helping to migrate from older versions of dojo to newer ones.
