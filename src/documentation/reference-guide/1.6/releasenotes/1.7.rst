_TemplatedMixin, _WidgetsInTemplateMixin
----------------------------------------
A new mixin called _TemplatedMixin has been added.  It's lighter weight than _Templated and supports templated widgets which *don't* have widgets in templates.  New widgets should be built using _TemplatedMixin.   Additionally, widgets that need the widgetsInTemplate functionality should also mixin _WidgetsInTemplateMixin.

_Templated's functionality and API haven't changed.

_setXXXAttr
-----------
Previously _setXXXAttr was a function to set a widget attribute.   It can still be a function, but now it can also be an object like one of the values from attributeMap.

For example, this will copy the widget's tabIndex attribute to this.focusNode.tabIndex

   .. code-block :: javascript

       _setTabIndexAttr: "focusNode"

And with the code below, myWidget.set("title", "hello world") will set this.titleNode.innerHTML to "hello world":

   .. code-block :: javascript

       __setTitleAttr: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerHTML" }


This replaces attributeMap, which is deprecated and will be removed in 2.0.


_CalendarLite

Dijit
-----
- Many widgets which used to include the parser no longer do.   If your page isn't parsing, check that you remembered the dojo.require("dojo.parser") call

- Many widgets which used to extend _Templated now extend _TemplatedMixin.   If you have custom widgets that extend standard widgets, and use widgetsInTemplate: true, you may need to also mixin dijit._WidgetsInTemplate

- The dijit.Calendar template has been modified to have ${!dayCellsHtml} and ${!dateRowsHtml} variables for the M-F (days of week) row, and the 1-31 days-of-the-month cells.  Custom calendar templates should be updated to contain these variables rather than markup for those sections.  If custom versions of Calendar need to modify the structure of days-of-week or days-of-month cells, they can override the new Calendar attributes: dowTemplateString, dateTemplateString, and weekTemplateString.
